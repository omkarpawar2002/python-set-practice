# Python Set Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python programs that demonstrate various operations and problem-solving techniques using the **set** data type.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Covered

The exercises cover:

- Creating sets
- Adding/removing elements
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
- Subset and superset checks
- Disjoint sets
- Frozensets
- Finding unique items, max/min, frequency
- Problem-solving using sets (e.g. anagrams, combinations, prefix finding)

## ðŸ§  Why Sets?

Sets are an important part of Python and are used for:
- Removing duplicates
- Performing mathematical set operations
- Efficient membership tests
- Solving real-world problems like finding unique values, common items, etc.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

To get started, clone this repository and try solving the problems in each file. Explanations and expected outputs are provided where relevant.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omkarpawar2002/python-set-practice.git
